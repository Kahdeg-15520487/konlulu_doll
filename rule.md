2. Once the konlulu~ switch behind the doll is flipped, the game start
3. Everyone's passing the doll along, while the doll is saying **"kon, kon"** with its eyes flashing red
* A list of people based on who joined will be used to determine who gets passed down to
* The person holding the doll (doll hugging) can choose to **Offer** and as a result speed up the doll's timer
4. The **"kon, kon"** get faster and faster, ultimately ending with an explosion
* The fuse timer is random every match
* For a fixed interval, a gif of the lulu doll will show up and give hint on how much time less until it explode
